## What is LinHT?

**LinHT** is an open-source handheld **software-defined radio (SDR) transceiver**
built around a modern Linux System-on-Module and a true IQ RF front-end.

It is the **successor of the OpenHT project**, with focus on:

* simpler and more maintainable hardware,
* no FPGA in the signal path,
* tight integration with Linux, GNU Radio, and modern SDR tooling,
* long-term openness and hackability.

LinHT is developed by members of the [**M17 community**](https://m17project.org) and is intended primarily
for **radio amateurs, SDR experimenters, and developers**.

This repository contains the **hardware design files** for LinHT.

## Key ideas behind LinHT

* **True SDR**: IQ baseband access, not FM-only
* **Linux-first**: Linux runs the UI, DSP, and radio control; the ATtiny handles
  power sequencing
* **No FPGA**: easier development, lower entry barrier
* **Open everything**: hardware, software, toolchains
* **Hackable handheld**: not just another black box walkie-talkie

## Hardware overview

LinHT is built around a Linux SoM and a wideband IQ transceiver.

### RF capabilities

The values below describe the tested Rev B hardware and the current Rev C
design. Rev C retains the same main RF chain but must be measured again after
manufacturing.

| Parameter       | Value                                                         |

## Hardware revisions

LinHT is developed iteratively. Each revision serves a specific purpose.

| Revision   | Status                                        | Purpose                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Rev. A** | Completed | Architecture proof of concept |
| **Rev. B** | Prototype tested | Integrated feature prototype and system testing |

See the [project changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for the changes introduced by each
hardware revision.

## Repository contents

This repository contains:

* KiCad 10 project files
* Schematics
* PCB layout
* Manufacturing outputs (generated automatically)

Gerbers, BOM, pick-and-place files, and schematics are:

* generated automatically via **GitHub Actions**
* published on [**GitHub Pages**](https://m17-project.github.io/LinHT-hw/)

Generated outputs follow the current `main` branch and therefore currently
represent the unvalidated Rev C design. Use the `revA` and `revB` Git tags for
historical revision snapshots.

## Required hardware (donor radio)

LinHT is designed as a **replacement mainboard** for the
**Retevis C62 handheld radio**. You will need:

* a Retevis C62 (donor device)
* its:
    * enclosure
    * display
    * keypad
    * battery
    * side-button PCB
    * SMA connector and audio jacks
    * rotary encoder, springs, and mechanical hardware

## Flashing the device

Flashing is done using **NXP Universal Update Utility (uuu)**.

The intended Rev C workflow is to hold the secondary side button while powering
on. The ATtiny then requests USB boot from the SoM through the corrected
level-domain interface. This Rev C workflow has not yet been validated on
manufactured hardware.

Rev B cannot use the side-button USB-boot function reliably. Its ATtiny firmware
disables that behavior; development boards are flashed by interrupting U-Boot
over the Kenwood connector and running `ums 0 mmc 0`, or by manually driving the
SoM `USB_BOOT` input. See the
[Rev B status report](https://m17project.org/2026/06/16/linht-rev-b-status-what-works-what-broke-and-why-rev-c-is-next/)
for the hardware background.

Once the board is in USB boot mode, flash it using:

```bash
uuu -v -b emmc_all imx-boot-mcm-imx93-sd.bin-flash_singleboot linht-image-mcm-imx93.rootfs.wic.zst
```

## FAQ – Frequently Asked Questions

### ❓ Where can I buy LinHT hardware?

You currently **cannot buy LinHT as a product**. To build LinHT, you need to:

* manufacture the PCB yourself (using provided Gerbers),
* source components,
* assemble the board,
* reuse the parts listed under [Required hardware](#required-hardware-donor-radio)
  from a **Retevis C62** donor radio.

This may change in the future.

### ❓ Is LinHT suitable for everyday radio use?

Not yet. And maybe never in the "consumer radio" sense. LinHT is currently best
suited for:

* developers,
* radio amateurs comfortable with Linux,
* SDR experimenters,
* people who enjoy building and debugging hardware.

You should **not** expect:

* plug-and-play user experience,
* polished UI,
* certification,
* warranty,
* commercial-grade RF compliance.

### ❓ Does LinHT support VHF?

**No. The current LinHT hardware revisions are UHF-only.**

VHF support is a **frequently requested feature**, but it is
not currently planned. Adding another band significantly increases:

* RF complexity,
* filtering requirements,
* PCB area,
* development time.

Right now, the project is focused on:

* manufacturing and validating Rev C,
* improving software and DSP,
* validating the RF chain, power management, audio, and GNSS integration.

VHF is **not ruled out** for future revisions, but it is
**not a current priority**.

### ❓ Is LinHT certified / legal to transmit with?

LinHT itself is **not certified**. Responsibility lies with the builder and
the operator. LinHT is intended primarily for:

* amateur radio use,
* experimental licenses,
* lab and research environments.

Always follow your local radio regulations.

### ❓ I want to help. Where do I start?

The best starting point is **discussion**. Join the M17 Discord, channel: **#linht**.

Good ways to contribute:

* software development (Yocto, drivers, tooling),
* testing and feedback,
* documentation,
* RF/DSP experiments,
* CI and automation improvements.

If you’re unsure where to help - just ask.
